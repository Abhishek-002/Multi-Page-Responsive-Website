# Multi-Page-Responsive-Website
Responsive web design means that a website can legibly fit the screen of any mobile device.
All of the text is readable, all of the images are clear, and everything fits the screen as perfectly as on a laptop or desktop computer.
From a technical standpoint, responsive web design is based on percentages.
A responsive web design company assigns varying percentages to the proportions and dimensions of elements on the web page, including images, columns, and text boxes, using professional website design tools.
Thanks to the percentages they assign to these site elements, the layout of the responsive website automatically makes adjustments and scales everything on the original site to fit a mobile userâ€™s device screen.
